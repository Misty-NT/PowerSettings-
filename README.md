# PowerSettings- This script operates in two parts:

Pull Current Configurations: The first part retrieves the computer's current power and hibernation settings, saving them into a temporary folder on the C: drive.
Set Power Settings: It then configures all power settings to "never off."
The second part of the script restores all power settings back to their original configurations.
